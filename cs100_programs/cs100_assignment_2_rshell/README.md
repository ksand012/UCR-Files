Overview of ARRR SHELL
------------
For this program we will read in user input, take the string they typed, and check for text flags (i.e. || && ;). Then we will separate
the string into smaller strings that are made up of the information separated by each flag. We finally will execute each of the smaller
sub-strings.

We will start by prompting the user for an input. Once the user input is received, the code will be read until a connector or null
character is reached. This segment will be separated into its own process, and the code will continue. If a connector was reached,
the code will continue reading the input for more commands. If a null character is reached, the input is over and the previous
commands will be executed. At any time, if the program reaches a pound sign, the rest of the input is ignored as a comment. Each
command of the input is checked for validity, then forked. The parent process is told to wait, while the codeâ€™s logic is run on the child.
The value of the child is returned and the child is killed, with the code continuing using the parent.
